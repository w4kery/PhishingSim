# Improve Phishing Email Project
## Let's give you some context

You are an analyst in our **Security Awareness Team.**

Our Chief Security Officer (CSO) relies on our team to help our staff learn how to identify and report security threats to **Mastercard.**

One of the most common threats organizations face today is **phishing**. So, what is phishing?

- Phishing is the act of pretending to be someone/something to get information, in most cases, this is usually a password.
- Attackers may send links or attachments designed to infect the recipient's system with malicious software or lure them into providing financial information, system credentials, or other sensitive data.
- Successful phishing attempts can cost companies like Mastercard millions of dollars and put our employees at risk. So it’s very important that we keep the business and our staff safe from harm.

At **Mastercard**, one of the ways we mitigate phishing threats is by educating our people about the risks and how to identify them. An effective way to build awareness is through **phishing simulation** campaigns:

- We test our staff every month by sending a fake phishing email that is made to look like something a bad actor would send.
- We use the results of the simulated test to help us design and implement future training.

## What can a phishing email look like?

A few months back, we detected a phishing email that was being used by an external bad actor on some of our employees.

Thankfully, it failed due to being an obvious fake. However, we know that phishing emails are now getting very sophisticated and a range of tactics are used.

See below what an ‘obvious fake’ might look like.

## Your task is to create a believable phishing email

Your manager wants you to lead **Mastercard’s next phishing simulation campaign**. This is an awesome opportunity for you to step up and show what you can do.

The first step is to create the fake phishing email to use in the simulation.

To create a ‘good’ phishing email, you should:

- Add some context at the beginning - make it relevant to a **Mastercard employee**
- Mask the hyperlink within text
- Use correct spelling and grammar
- Add points of legitimacy

## Here is the final result of the updated phishing email campaign I've created:

## Summary:
The **Improve Phishing Email Project** aims to enhance the security awareness of Mastercard employees by conducting phishing simulation campaigns. As part of the Security Awareness Team, the goal is to educate staff about the risks of phishing and improve their ability to identify and report security threats. The project involves creating believable phishing emails for simulation, incorporating relevant context, masking hyperlinks, ensuring correct spelling and grammar, and adding points of legitimacy. The overall objective is to proactively prepare and protect Mastercard and its employees against sophisticated phishing threats.
